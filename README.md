# Code-a-pookalam
This is a project done as part of tinkerhub geck code a pookalam competetion.

The project is web page interface that allows the user to input the number of circles, their raddi, number of petals, their radii and the distance of petal from the centre and color of it. The idea is to realieze a simple pookalm design and how the user can vary the design by increasing the number of petals, circles and colour. 
The below design was my inital attempt to code. but to the difficulty in the complex geometric hand drawn shapes, the digitalization of this code was quite a task. i ended up with a simplier design with user interface interaction that allows them to modify the some parameters in the design.

So the new design and the coded pookalam looks like this.

Defintely, the refernce image and coded one has no big similarites but it works!

Have fun by changing the pookalam!
